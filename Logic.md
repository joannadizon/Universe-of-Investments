### What Are Stochastics?
In technical analysis, stochastics refer to a group of oscillator indicators that point to buying or selling opportunities based on momentum. In statistics, the word stochastic refers to something that is subject to a probability distribution, such as a random variable.<sup>[\[1\]](#1)</sup> In trading, the use of this term is meant to indicate that the current price of a security can be related to a range of possible outcomes, or relative to its price range over some time period.<sup>[\[2\]](#2)</sup>

### How Can I Use Stochastics in Trading?
The stochastic indicator establishes a range with values indexed between 0 and 100. A reading of 80+ points to a security being overbought, and is a sell signal. Readings 20 or lower are considered oversold and indicate a buy.<sup>[\[3\]](#3)</sup>
